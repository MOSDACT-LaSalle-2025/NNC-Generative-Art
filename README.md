Description:
Ripple grid that reacts to mouse distance using a sine wave. Sliders + arrow keys change speed, wave density, stroke getting thinner the further you are from the mouse.

My approach was to explore a parametric system. I wanted to create some type of ripple effect that would move with the mouse position.
I believe it's generative because the output emerges from a set of rules or parameters  while it  keeps evolving based on input (mouse & time). 

Place of production: Barcelona

Instructions:
- SPACE = play/pause animation
- LEFT / RIGHT = speed -, +
- UP / DOWN = wave density +, -
- SHIFT + LEFT / RIGHT = stroke wight concetrates around mouse -, +
- SHIFT + UP / DOWN = feather -, +
- [ / ] = decrease/increase MAX diameter
- { / } = decrease/increase MIN diameter
- Hold mouse = strobe flash
- SAVE PNG button or press S
- START/STOP MP4 button or press V
