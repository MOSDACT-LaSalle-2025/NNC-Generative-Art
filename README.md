# NancyElAzzi_generative_Art

Date: September 2, 2025
Description:
Circles grid with ripple effect that reacts to mouse position. Modifiable radius range, speed and wave density, stroke also gets thinner the further you are from the mouse.

My approach was to explore a parametric system. I wanted to create some type of ripple effect that would move with the mouse position.
The goal was to create something mesmerizing and simple that viewers play with using their mouse and some parameters.
Althought the artist has some control over the output, I believe it's generative because it mainly emerges from a set of rules while evolving based on input (parameters, mouse & time). Each viewer can generate their own piece, export a frame or even a video if they please.

Place of production: Barcelona

Instructions:
- SPACE = play/pause animation - still cool to play around with the mouse
- LEFT / RIGHT = speed -, +
- UP / DOWN = wave density +, -
- SHIFT + LEFT / RIGHT = stroke wight concetrates around mouse -, +
- SHIFT + UP / DOWN = feather -, +
- [ / ] = decrease/increase MAX diameter
- { / } = decrease/increase MIN diameter
- Hold mouse = strobe flash
- SAVE PNG button or press S
- START/STOP MP4 button or press V
